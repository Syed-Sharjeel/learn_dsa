# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains **codelabs and implementations** from my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** course at **NED University of Engineering & Technology (NEDUET)**.  
The repo is intended to help fellow students understand **basic algorithms, sorting, recursion, object-oriented programming, and fundamental data structures** using Python.

1. Introduction to programming with Python  
2. Developing and executing algorithms using Python  
3. Analyze efficiency of sorting algorithms  
4. Recursive **divide & conquer** approach in sorting  
5. Extend divide & conquer to sorting and searching problems  
6. Apply **Asymptotic Notations** to sorting algorithms  
7. Introduction to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
8. Develop a system for **basic banking tasks** (OOP-based)  
9. Implement fundamental data structures (using Python lists)
